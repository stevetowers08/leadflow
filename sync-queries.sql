We have a product that customers are strongly engaged with, and every month we get 1000s of new leads in our core/target regions with 0 cold calling and limited marketing spend (made possible by strong word-of-mouth and organic marketing efforts).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sitemate’s founders have diverse backgrounds - one coming from engineering on major infrastructure projects; the second coming from product and graphic design. This brings a unique perspective internally where we blend deep industry experience with a passion (obsession) for modern best practices in product design.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sitemate graduated from Australia’s #1 Technology Company Accelerator - Startmate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sitemate has strong financial backing from Blackbird (Australia and NZ’s #1 Vc), Shearwater Growth Capital &amp;amp; Marbruck Investments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;See info on our latest raise here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the working environment like at Sitemate?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We are very transparent - monthly Allhands meetings provide the team with direct insight into team updates, customer stories, hiring plans and key metrics (NPS, Revenue, Financial Performance). During this Allhands meeting we also hear one ‘life story’ from one of our team each month - learning about different countries and cultures around the world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We place an extremely high value on your time - you won’t be spending your days wasting time on fighting internal systems, botched together spreadsheet processes or doing data entry.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We use best in class systems that are seamlessly integrated to deliver our team the right information at the right time, allowing them to get their work done efficiently and to a very high standard.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You will have a core and close team around you, but you will also be exposed to and working directly with multiple departments - engineering, product, design, marketing, sales and customer success.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You will have a high degree of autonomy, as the focus is on outcomes and not hours. If you want to block off a few hours to run a personal errand or block off an hour to pick up the kids from school - no worries. No one will be monitoring your time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We are constantly working to minimise the number of group meetings - daily check ins are all done asynchronously (in your own time) each morning. But spontaneous 1:1s or small sessions are strongly encouraged!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does Sitemate do, exactly?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sitemate builds best in class software products for the built world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Industrial companies operating in the built world are facing a number of mission critical challenges - changes in work behaviour as Generation Z start to enter the workforce as mobile first users of software, and the drastic shift away from traditional mining to renewable energy projects such as wind farms and solar farms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our first product - Dashpivot, is a platform where industrial style companies streamline and standardise their processes in a new digital format.

After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn''t work together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we''ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time.
