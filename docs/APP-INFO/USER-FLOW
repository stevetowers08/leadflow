# User Flow Guide: Recruitment CRM

## Philosophy: "Do the Thing, Fast"

Onboarding should help users do the thing fast - identify the "one thing" your users are trying to do (their "aha" moment) and streamline your flow to help them do that as quickly and easily as possible.

For your app, **the "one thing"** is: **Turn a job posting into an outreach message to a decision maker.**

---

## 1. New User Onboarding Flow

### First Login Experience

Focus on getting users to experience value as soon as possible - deliver quick wins like helping users import their initial batch of contacts in a CRM.

**Goal**: Get to first qualified company + first message sent within 15 minutes

#### Step 1: Welcome + Quick Setup (2 minutes)

```
1. Welcome screen with value proposition
   "Find clients through job postings in 3 steps"

2. Quick profile setup:
   - What type of roles do you recruit for? (dropdown)
   - What industries? (multi-select)
   - Where are you located? (for job filtering)

3. Connect integrations (optional, can skip):
   - Gmail (for sending)
   - LinkedIn (for outreach tracking)

   [Skip for now] [Connect Gmail] buttons
```

**Why this works**: Customization ensures relevance, making users feel seen and understood. This approach streamlines their learning experience

#### Step 2: Import First Jobs (3 minutes)

```
Automatically land on Jobs Feed page

Overlay tooltip:
"These are jobs scraped from LinkedIn that match your criteria.

```

## 6. Critical User Flows: Success Metrics

### Primary Success Metric: Time to First Message

**Target**: <15 minutes from signup

**Measurement points**:

1. Account created → timestamp
2. First job qualified → timestamp
3. First company created → timestamp
4. First message sent → timestamp

**Funnel**:

```
100% → Sign up
 90% → Qualify first job (10% drop-off)
 80% → Find decision makers (10% drop-off)
 65% → Send first message (15% drop-off)
```

**Goal**: Minimize drop-off at each stage

---

### Secondary Metrics

**Engagement (Daily Active Users)**:

- Dashboard visit
- Jobs viewed
- Companies researched
- Messages sent

**Target behaviors**:

- 3-5 jobs qualified per day
- 2-3 companies researched per day
- 5-10 messages sent per week
- 1-2 responses per week

**Retention triggers**:

- Response received (highest retention driver)
- Meeting scheduled (conversion event)
- Client won (ultimate success)

---

## 7. Edge Cases & Error States

### Error Flow A: No Decision Makers Found

```
User clicks "Find Decision Makers"
→ System searches LinkedIn
→ No results found

Show message:
"We couldn't find decision makers automatically.
You can:
- Add contacts manually
- Try again later (we're improving our search)
- Skip for now and come back"

[Add Manually] [Try Again] [Skip]
```

---

### Error Flow B: Duplicate Company

```
User tries to qualify job
→ System detects company already in pipeline

Show modal:
"This company is already in your pipeline!
Status: Outreach Started
Last activity: 3 days ago

[View Company] [Qualify Anyway as Separate Job]"
```

---

### Error Flow C: Email Sending Fails

```
User sends message via Gmail
→ Gmail API error (rate limit, auth expired)

Show error:
"Message couldn't be sent.
Reason: Gmail rate limit reached

What to do:
- Copy message to clipboard and send manually
- Try again in 1 hour
- Check Gmail connection in Settings"

[Copy Message] [Try Again] [Settings]
```

---

## 8. Mobile User Flow (Simplified)

**Philosophy**: Mobile is for checking and light actions, not deep work

### Mobile Priority Flows

**Check notifications** (30 seconds):

```
1. Open app
2. Dashboard shows:
   - "3 new responses"
   - "5 follow-ups due today"
3. Tap notification → View response
4. Quick reply or mark for desktop follow-up
```

**Quick job qualification** (1-2 minutes):

```
1. Jobs tab → New
2. Swipe through jobs (Tinder-style)
3. Swipe right = Qualify
4. Swipe left = Skip
5. Job qualified → Toast: "Added to pipeline"
```

**Review company** (read-only):

```
1. Companies tab
2. Tap company → Full screen view
3. Scroll through:
   - Company info
   - Decision makers
   - Recent activity
4. Can mark favorites, add notes
5. Deep actions (messaging) → "Continue on desktop"
```

**Mobile = Triage, Desktop = Deep Work**

---

## 9. User Flow Best Practices Summary

### Do's:

✅ Start the onboarding process immediately after someone engages with your brand - send welcome email right after signup to bring people into the fold early

✅ Help users do the thing fast - identify their "aha moment" and streamline your flow to help them achieve it as quickly as possible

✅ Help customers understand how your product helps them at every touchpoint - retention possibility increases significantly when you treat customer interactions as a holistic experience

✅ Progressive disclosure: Show complexity gradually

✅ Celebrate wins: Toast notifications for completed actions

✅ Clear CTAs: Always show next step

✅ Minimal clicks: 3 clicks to any action

✅ Escape hatches: Always allow "Skip" or "Do Later"

### Don'ts:

❌ Don't force linear onboarding (let users explore)

❌ Don't hide key features behind menus

❌ Don't require too much info upfront

❌ Don't make users read long instructions

❌ Don't auto-play videos or modals that block content

❌ Don't have dead ends (always show next action)
